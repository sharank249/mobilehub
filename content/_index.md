      **Smartphones and tablets run on batteries, which means they have to use
      power as efficiently as possible. It's not feasible to provide the high,
      constant power to a device's CPU from such a small battery. Consequently,
      the newest smartphone will not give you as much power as a high-end
      desktop computer. Mobile devices are getting more powerful every month,
      but traditional computers will always have the performance edge, due to
      consistent access to more electricity.**
