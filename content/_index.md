          **Smartphones and tablets run on batteries, which means they have to
          use power as efficiently as possible. It's not feasible to provide the
          high, constant power to a device's CPU from such a small battery.
          Consequently, the newest smartphone will not give you as much power as
          a high-end desktop computer. Mobile devices are getting more powerful
          every month, but traditional computers will always have the
          performance edge, due to consistent access to more electricity.**
